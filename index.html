      <h3>Who I am?</h3>
      <!-- <p>After nearly a decade writing about technology, software, internet and social networks in media such as <i>Genbeta</i> or <i>Xataka</i>, I remembered how much I liked to investigate how websites worked when I was a kid, the projects I built with WordPress and I decided to go to the other side training as a programmer.</p>
      <p>I studied the <b>Full Stack Web Development</b> bootcamp at CodeHouse Academy, combining it with a part-time job, in which besides starting from the base with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, learning the basics of programming with <b>JavaScript</b> and working with <b>Angular</b>, we have done projects with <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express</b>, treated <b>MySQL</b> and <b>MongoDB</b> databases, took version control with <b>Git</b> and applied <b>Scrum</b> for agile development. With this training I have gained a broad view of what is development on one side and the other.</p>
      <p>I have <b>great skills in digital environments</b> because of my professional background and my fondness for technology, I know what it's like to work remotely for years and teamwork.</p>
      <p>My goal is to continue acquiring knowledge and skills, strengthen them and, of course, apply them in a company as a developer giving the best of myself.</p>
      <p>I am curious by nature, involved, optimistic, hardworking, I love 'escape rooms' and I am very eager both to learn and to contribute to a company that values all this.</p> -->
      <p>I have been a technology journalist for almost a decade and recently decided to switch careers and become a programmer.</p>
      <p>I completed a <b>Full Stack Web Development bootcamp</b> at Codehouse Academy where I learned the foundations of <b>HTML and CSS</b>, programming with <b>JavaScript</b>, and worked with <b>Angular</b>. I also completed projects with <b>Node.js and Express</b>, worked with <b>MySQL and MongoDB databases</b>, practiced <b>version control with Git</b>, and applied <b>Scrum for agile development</b>.</p>
      <p>I have <b>strong skills in digital environments</b> due to my professional background and my love for technology. I am experienced in working remotely and as part of a team.</p>
      <p>My goal is to continue learning and improving my skills as a developer, especially in the frontend field with the technologies I have worked with, and to add value with my work.</p>
      <p>I am curious by nature, committed, optimistic and hardworking.</p>
